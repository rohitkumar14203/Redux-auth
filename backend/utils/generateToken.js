/*
What is JWT?
JWT = JSON Web Token

It‚Äôs a secure way to send data (like user ID) between client and server.
After a user logs in, we create a token and send it to the client.
The client (browser/app) will send this token in future requests as proof of login.

* jwt.sign(payload, secret, options)
This is the method to generate a JWT.

Part     -------  What it does
payload  -------  The data you want to include in the token (usually userId, email, etc.)
secret   -------  A secret key (string) to encrypt the token. Stored in .env file.
options  -------  Like how long the token should be valid (expiresIn, etc.)


! userId in payload
{ userId }

We send this inside the token so that later, when we decode the token, we can get which user sent the request.
This avoids querying the database every time.
It‚Äôs like:
üëâ ‚ÄúThis request is from user with ID = 654654dd... Trust me, here‚Äôs the proof (token).‚Äù

process.env.JWT_SECRET
This is your private key to encrypt and decrypt tokens.
Only your server knows this secret.
That‚Äôs how the server can verify the token later.

expiresIn: "30d"
The token will expire in 30 days.
After that, the user will need to log in again.
